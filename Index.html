    <h3>How does card to card (P2P) work?</h3>
    <p>
    A P2P (Peer-to-Peer) payment system is a method of transferring money directly between individuals, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries. 
    <br> This system allows for easy and quick payment from one person to another, either through bank cart or using a transit number. The growing popularity of P2P systems can be seen in their integration into mobile applications allowing users to send money to other instantly, often without the need for a bank accaunt or physical presence. </br>
    <br> The system works by allowing two parties (the "peers") to connect directly, eithier through a mobile application or a bank's online platform, to trasfer funds. The funds can be sent from one user's bank accaunt to another user's bank accaunt in a matter of a seconds or minutes. P2P systems are commonly used for various types transactions, including person-to-person transfers, bill payments, and even online online purchases. </br>
    <br> One of the most significant features of the P2P system is its convinience. Users can make transfers anywhere, at any time, through mobile devices or computers. This system also eliminates the need for physical cash, reducing the risk of theft and offering more secure transaction process.

    <h3>Who can work in the bank career?</h3>
    <p>
      A career in banking is open to a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and levels of education. While some roles require specialized degrees or certifications, others may be available to those who are just starting out or coming from different industries. The banking sector is vast and includes positions in retail banking, investment banking, corporate banking, risk management, customer service, compliance, financial analysis, and more others. Because of this diversity, almost anyone with the right mindset, interest, and dedication can pursue a job in banking.
      <br> ABOUT EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Most banks prefer candidates with at least a bachelor's degree in fields such as finance, accaunting, business administration, or economics. However, for entry-level positions like bank teller or customer service agents, a high school diploma or equivalent may be sufficient. For more advanced roles like financial analysts, auditors, or investment bankers, a degree in finance, mathematics, or business is often necessery - sometimes even a master's degree such as an MBA. </br>

    <h3>How was the bank created?</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of a bank has evolved over thousands of years, beginning as a simple method of storing and lending money and eventually becoming the complex financial institutions we know today. Banks were created to meet the growing need for a safe place to store wealth, facilitate trade, lend money, and manage financial transacrions. 
        <br> Classical Banking In Greece And Rome: In ancient Greece and Rome, banking became more sophisticated. Moneylenders and private individuals began offering loans and accepting deposits in return for interest. They also facilitated currency exchange, which was crucial in regions with various local currencies. These early banks operated out of market places or religious temples and were essential in financing trade and commerce. </br>
        <br> ABOUT THE BIRTH OF MODERN BANKING: Modern banking as we know it began in the 17th century. The first official bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was established in Italy in 1472 and still operates today. In 1694, the Bank of England was founded, marking a major shift toward central banking. It was created to help finance government spending and manage public debt. This led to the introduction of standardized currency, banknotes, and a formalized banking system that could support a national economy. </br> 
        <br> ABOUT EXPLANATION AND REGULATION: As the Industrial Revolution took hold in the 18th and 19th centuries, banks expanded rapidly to fund industrial projects, build infrastructure, and support global trade. Commercial and investment banks emerged, each serving different roles in the economy. Governments also began regulating banks to ensure stability, protect customers, and prevent fraud. </br>
        <br> ABOUT MODERN-DAY BANKS: Today’s banks are highly regulated, technology-driven institutions that provide a wide range of services, including checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, digital banking, investment services, and more. Central banks like the U.S Federal Reserve, The European Central Bank, and others oversee monetary policy and ensure economic stability. </br>
